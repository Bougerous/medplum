## 🎉 Conclusion

The LIMS application has been successfully implemented using Angular as requested. It provides a complete demonstration of Phase 1 functionality from the implementation guide and serves as a solid foundation for integration with the Medplum platform. The application is currently running and ready for demonstration or further development.

**Access the application**: `http://localhost:4200`

The next logical step would be to replace the mock MedplumService with actual Medplum client integration to connect to a real FHIR server and begin handling actual healthcare data.
