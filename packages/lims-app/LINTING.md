# Automatic Linting Setup

This project has been configured with automatic linting to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Features

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks
- **Husky** + **lint-staged** automatically runs ESLint on staged files before each commit
- Only linting files that are actually being committed (faster than linting everything)
- Automatically fixes auto-fixable issues

### 2. VS Code Integration
- **Auto-fix on save**: ESLint automatically fixes issues when you save files
- **Real-time linting**: See linting errors and warnings as you type
- **Quick fixes**: Use VS Code's quick fix suggestions to resolve issues

### 3. Continuous Integration
- **GitHub Actions** runs linting on every push and pull request
- Ensures code quality is maintained across the team
- Prevents merging code with linting errors

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Run ESLint on all TypeScript files
npm run lint

# Run ESLint with auto-fix
npm run lint:fix

# Run ESLint in watch mode (auto-runs on file changes)
npm run lint:watch

# Run ESLint auto-fix on all files
npm run lint:fix-all

# Run automatic fix script (fixes unused variables + ESLint)
npm run lint:auto-fix
```

## How It Works

### Pre-commit Hook
When you commit code, the following happens automatically:
1. **lint-staged** identifies which files are staged for commit
2. **ESLint** runs on only those files
3. **Auto-fix** applies fixes to auto-fixable issues
4. **Git add** stages the fixed files
5. **Commit** proceeds only if no errors remain

### VS Code Auto-fix
- Save any file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S) to automatically fix linting issues
- See linting errors in real-time with red underlines
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "ESLint: Fix all auto-fixable Problems"

### Automatic Fix Script
The `lint:auto-fix` script:
1. Finds all TypeScript files in the project
2. Removes underscore prefixes from unused variables
3. Runs ESLint auto-fix on all files
4. Reports progress and any remaining issues

## Configuration Files

- **`.eslintrc.json`**: ESLint rules and configuration
- **`.husky/pre-commit`**: Pre-commit hook script
- **`package.json`**: lint-staged configuration and scripts
- **`.vscode/settings.json`**: VS Code linting settings
- **`.github/workflows/lint.yml`**: GitHub Actions CI workflow

## Best Practices

1. **Save frequently**: Take advantage of auto-fix on save
2. **Check before committing**: The pre-commit hook will catch issues
3. **Use the auto-fix script**: Run `npm run lint:auto-fix` to fix common issues
4. **Address warnings**: While warnings don't block commits, they indicate code quality issues
5. **Review CI results**: Check GitHub Actions for any linting failures

## Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit hook not working
```bash
# Reinstall husky
npm run prepare
```

### VS Code not showing linting errors
1. Install the ESLint extension
2. Reload VS Code
3. Check that the ESLint extension is enabled for TypeScript files

### Auto-fix not working
```bash
# Clear ESLint cache
npx eslint --cache-location .eslintcache --cache false src/**/*.ts

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Build working without errors
- ✅ ESLint configured and running
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks active
- ✅ VS Code integration working
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
- ⚠️ Some code quality issues remain (unused variables, explicit any types)

The remaining issues are primarily code quality improvements that can be addressed incrementally.
