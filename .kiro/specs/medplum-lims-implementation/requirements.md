# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) on the Medplum platform. The system will transform the existing Angular-based mock application into a production-ready, FHIR-native LIMS that supports the complete laboratory workflow from patient registration through revenue cycle management.

The LIMS will serve histopathology and microbiology laboratories with specialized workflows, QR code-based specimen tracking, role-based user interfaces, and integrated billing capabilities. The system will leverage Medplum's FHIR-native architecture, Bot automation engine, and compliance framework to create a scalable, interoperable healthcare solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Medplum Platform Integration

**User Story:** As a laboratory administrator, I want the LIMS to be built on the Medplum platform so that we have a FHIR-native, compliant, and interoperable foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use Medplum's hosted service for HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance

3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use Medplum's FHIR-based RESTful API
4. WHEN authentication occurs THEN it SHALL use Medplum's identity and access management system
5. WHEN workflows are automated THEN they SHALL use Medplum Bots with TypeScript code

### Requirement 2: Identity and Access Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive role-based access control so that users can only access data and functions appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created THEN they SHALL be assigned a FHIR Practitioner profile within a Medplum Project
2. WHEN access policies are defined THEN they SHALL use FHIRPath expressions for dynamic, context-aware rules
3. WHEN a user authenticates THEN their permissions SHALL be enforced at the server level for all API requests
4. WHEN different user roles access the system THEN they SHALL see role-specific interfaces and data
5. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the attempt

### Requirement 3: Pre-Analytical Workflow Enhancement

**User Story:** As a lab technician, I want enhanced patient registration and specimen accessioning capabilities so that I can efficiently process samples with proper tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient is registered THEN the system SHALL create FHIR Patient, Coverage, and Consent resources
2. WHEN a specimen is accessioned THEN it SHALL generate a unique accession identifier and create a FHIR Specimen resource
3. WHEN QR code labels are needed THEN the system SHALL generate printable labels with QR codes containing specimen identifiers
4. WHEN orders are placed THEN they SHALL support order splitting for multiple specimen types
5. WHEN clinical information is required THEN the system SHALL present dynamic Ask-on-Order-Entry questionnaires

### Requirement 4: Advanced Analytical Workflows

**User Story:** As a pathologist, I want specialized histopathology and microbiology workflows so that I can process complex specimens with proper digital integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN histopathology specimens are processed THEN each step SHALL be modeled as FHIR Procedure and Observation resources
2. WHEN whole slide imaging is performed THEN the system SHALL integrate with WSI scanners via Medplum Agent
3. WHEN digital pathology images are viewed THEN they SHALL be accessible through an integrated web-based viewer
4. WHEN microbiology cultures are processed THEN organism identification and susceptibility testing SHALL be recorded as structured FHIR Observations
5. WHEN SNOMED CT coding is required THEN the system SHALL use standardized terminologies for specimens and diagnoses

### Requirement 5: Post-Analytical Reporting and Validation

**User Story:** As a laboratory director, I want robust report generation and validation workflows so that only accurate, complete reports are released.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic reports are generated THEN they SHALL be assembled as FHIR DiagnosticReport resources with all related data
2. WHEN reports require validation THEN they SHALL progress through defined status transitions with automated rule enforcement
3. WHEN reports are finalized THEN they SHALL generate PDF versions stored as FHIR Binary resources
4. WHEN digital sign-off occurs THEN it SHALL create FHIR AuditEvent resources for compliance tracking
5. WHEN reports are released THEN they SHALL trigger downstream billing processes automatically

### Requirement 6: Revenue Cycle Management Integration

**User Story:** As a billing manager, I want integrated revenue cycle management so that claims are automatically generated and processed when reports are finalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a diagnostic report is finalized THEN the system SHALL automatically create FHIR Claim resources
2. WHEN claims are submitted THEN they SHALL be transmitted via Candid Health integration
3. WHEN claim responses are received THEN they SHALL be recorded as FHIR ClaimResponse resources
4. WHEN patient payments are required THEN the system SHALL generate invoices and payment links via Stripe
5. WHEN payments are received THEN they SHALL be reconciled using FHIR PaymentReconciliation resources

### Requirement 7: Role-Based User Interfaces

**User Story:** As a system user, I want interfaces that adapt to my role and permissions so that I can efficiently perform my specific job functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the interface SHALL dynamically adapt based on their ProjectMembership and AccessPolicy
2. WHEN different roles access dashboards THEN they SHALL see role-specific widgets and navigation options
3. WHEN actions are attempted THEN buttons and functions SHALL be enabled/disabled based on user permissions
4. WHEN data is displayed THEN it SHALL be filtered according to the user's access rights
5. WHEN workflows are presented THEN they SHALL be customized for the user's specific laboratory role

### Requirement 8: Patient and Provider Portals

**User Story:** As a patient, I want secure access to my laboratory results so that I can view reports and manage my healthcare information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patients access their portal THEN they SHALL only see their own DiagnosticReport resources
2. WHEN providers access their portal THEN they SHALL only see results for patients they have ordered tests for
3. WHEN electronic orders are placed THEN providers SHALL be able to create ServiceRequest resources directly
4. WHEN results are available THEN stakeholders SHALL receive real-time notifications
5. WHEN billing information is needed THEN patients SHALL be able to view and pay their portion securely

### Requirement 9: Operational Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a laboratory manager, I want comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities so that I can monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboards are accessed THEN they SHALL display real-time data powered by FHIR search queries
2. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide turnaround time, volume, and quality indicators
3. WHEN advanced analytics are required THEN data SHALL be exportable via FHIR Bulk Data Export API
4. WHEN compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide audit trails and regulatory reports
5. WHEN trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL support population health and clinical outcome studies

### Requirement 10: QR Code Specimen Tracking

**User Story:** As a lab technician, I want comprehensive QR code-based specimen tracking so that I can maintain chain of custody and prevent specimen mix-ups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specimens are accessioned THEN QR codes SHALL be generated containing unique specimen identifiers
2. WHEN labels are printed THEN they SHALL include both QR codes and human-readable information
3. WHEN QR codes are scanned THEN the system SHALL retrieve the complete Specimen resource
4. WHEN specimens move through workflow stations THEN their status SHALL be updated via QR code scanning
5. WHEN tracking is required THEN the complete specimen journey SHALL be auditable through FHIR resources
